# eternity-public
 
This repository contains the open-source release of some of [TacoNBanana](https://www.taconbanana.com/)'s Garry's Mod roleplay gamemodes. These gamemodes are based on eternity, a script that's been developed in house over the course of about a year.

Included is a snapshot of the code as it was at the time of release, minus any cleaning up of things like SteamID's, sensitive data and other snippets that we would prefer to keep to ourselves.

For more information including a brief setup guide and FAQ, check out the [wiki](../../wiki).

Halo is the version of the script used for the Halo RP server that was briefly run in 2020.
