# eternity-public
 
This repository contains the open-source release of some of our ([TacoNBanana](https://www.taconbanana.com/)) Garry's Mod roleplay gamemodes. These gamemodes are based on eternity, a script that's been developed in house over the course of about a year during the period of 2018-2019.

Included is a snapshot of the code as it was at the time of release minus any cleaning up of things like SteamID's, sensitive data and other snippets that we prefer to keep to ourselves.

For more information including a brief setup guide and FAQ, check out the [wiki](../../wiki).

Eternity is the base version of the script as it was first released to the public back in 2019.
